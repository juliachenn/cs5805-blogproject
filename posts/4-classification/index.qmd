# Blog Post 4: Classification - Fruit Recognition

## Processing the data

First, making sure scikit-image is installed for image processing

This blog post will apply the topic of classification with detecting different types of fruit (peach, banana, guava). Classification is a supervised learning task that involves predicting which class/group something (e.g. an image) belongs in. For this post, we will mainly use a grid search approach using a support vector classifer to classify the fruit images.

```{python}
%pip install scikit-image
```

```{python}
import os
from skimage.io import imread
from skimage import io
from skimage.transform import resize
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.svm import SVC
```

Let's get the directories of the images:

```{python}
curr_dir = ''
peach_dir = os.path.join(curr_dir, 'peach_data') #0
banana_dir = os.path.join(curr_dir, 'banana_data') #1
guava_dir = os.path.join(curr_dir, 'guava_data') #2
```

Here are some example images from our dataset

```{python}
peach = io.imread(os.path.join(peach_dir, 'Peach001.png'))
io.imshow(peach)
io.show()
```


```{python}

```
